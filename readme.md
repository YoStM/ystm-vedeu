# yohan-saint-martin.fr - v2

[My first personnal website is online](http://www.yohan-saint-martin.fr "Yohan Saint-Martin, DÃ©veloppeur web"), and many people found it ***pleasant*** and ***good looking***.
I love the fact that I got so many good feedbacks but to be honest, programmatically speaking, the website is not perfect.
I happen to have some time to kill so I decided to start putting more thoughts into the structure of the code.
I want to make the website more dynamic so that whenever I want to add a new feature, I don't have to rebuild the code base.

-----------------------------

## Specifications

    * PHP version 8.0.9
    * PHPMailer
    * Composer
    * Bootstrap version 5.1

## Objectives

    * Modify the structure of the code in a way that I could add new features and avoid changing the code base.
    * Create English contents.
    * Ensure accessibility features for people that suffer from impaired vision.
    * Write a manifest to explain why some of the projects were more meaningfull to me.
    * Create a portfolio page, which would showcase the projects I liked the most.
    * Add one or more features that would give a hint of what I can do with php.

Obviously, I want to make sure I keep things ***simple*** and ***maintanable***. I also want to ensure ***consistency*** throughout the website and a ***decent user experience***.
I want to make sure the user can find the website easily, from my [github profile](https://github.com/YoStM "YoStM - github.com"), from my [linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yohan-saint-martin-b7068151/ "Yohan Saint-Martin - LinkedIn").
In fact, all my social networks profile should point the webiste and the website to all social networks.
